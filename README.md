@math-for-shell is a collection of advanced math utilities, written in POSIX-conformant shell code with no external calls.
Tested under both dash and bash shells, but runs 3 times slower under bash.
- fp4sh -- fixed or infinite-precision decimal math functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division/modulo, 
exponentiation, root-solver, log10, log2, logn and e^x.
- bin4sh -- binary math functions for 2-way decimal/binary conversion, +, -, *, /, and exponentiation
- ai4sh -- proof-of-concept neural network using fp4sh
- repo is under construction as of 12 June 2021.
